# RAG Using LangChain with Google Gemini

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a **text-to-text generation application** using the **Google Gemini Pro LLM**. In this project, weâ€™ll explore various configuration parameters and employ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance the quality of responses.

## Steps Involved

1. **Set up the Environment**  
   Set up the necessary environment and import relevant libraries such as:
   - `google.generativeai`
   - `pathlib`
   - `textwrap`
   - `IPython`

2. **Start Interaction with Gemini Pro Model**  
   Begin by asking questions to the **Google Gemini Pro** model and save the **chat history** to track the conversation.

3. **Experiment with Configuration Parameters**  
   Experiment with different configuration parameters to influence the response behavior of the model:
   - **Temperature**
   - **Maximum output tokens**
   - **Top_k**
   - **Top_p**
   - **Candidate_count**

4. **Evaluate Response Quality**  
   Evaluate and analyze the quality of responses based on the set configuration parameters.

5. **Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
   Improve the quality of responses on specific topics by leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using documents, websites, or knowledge corpora of your choice.


## Key Features

- **Google Gemini-2.0-flash-exp**:  
  Integrated and experimented with various configuration parameters to control the model's response behavior.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:  
  Utilized RAG to enhance text generation with relevant context from large documents or datasets.

- **LangChain Integration**:  
  Used **LangChain** for managing data flow and generating contextually accurate text responses.

- **Customizable Configuration**:  
  Tweaked model settings like **temperature**, **top_k**, and **max tokens** to fine-tune output quality.

- **Save Chat History**:  
  Saved and analyzed the chat history for insights on how the model responds to different inputs.


## Skills & Technologies

- **Machine Learning**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Generative AI**
- **LangChain**
- **Python**


This project serves as a great foundation for building **LLM** (Large Language Model) applications, and it can be extended for more complex use cases such as **text generation**, **summarization**, and **image generation** tasks. 

Feel free to explore, experiment, and customize this project for your use cases!
